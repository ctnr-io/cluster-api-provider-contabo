# cluster-api-provider-contabo

A Kubernetes Cluster API provider for Contabo cloud infrastructure. This provider enables you to create and manage Kubernetes clusters on Contabo's VPS infrastructure using the Cluster API framework.

## Description

This Cluster API provider allows you to provision and manage Kubernetes clusters on Contabo's cloud infrastructure. It integrates with the Cluster API ecosystem to provide a consistent way to deploy workload clusters across different cloud providers.

The provider includes:
- **ContaboCluster**: Manages cluster-wide infrastructure (networking, load balancers)
- **ContaboMachine**: Manages individual virtual machines (VPS instances)
- **ContaboMachineTemplate**: Template for creating machines with consistent configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.03+
- kubectl version v1.11.3+
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster
- Contabo API credentials:
  - Client ID and Client Secret (OAuth2 application credentials)
  - API User and API Password (Contabo account credentials)
  All obtainable from the Contabo customer portal

### Quick Start

1. **Install clusterctl**
   ```sh
   curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases/latest/download/clusterctl-linux-amd64 -o clusterctl
   chmod +x clusterctl
   sudo mv clusterctl /usr/local/bin/clusterctl
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```sh
   export CONTABO_CLIENT_ID="your-oauth2-client-id"
   export CONTABO_CLIENT_SECRET="your-oauth2-client-secret"
   export CONTABO_API_USER="your-contabo-username"
   export CONTABO_API_PASSWORD="your-contabo-password"
   export CLUSTER_NAME="my-contabo-cluster"
   export KUBERNETES_VERSION="v1.28.0"
   export CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT=1
   export WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT=2
   ```

3. **Initialize the management cluster**
   ```sh
   clusterctl init --infrastructure contabo
   ```

4. **Generate cluster configuration**
   ```sh
   clusterctl generate cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
     --infrastructure contabo \
     --kubernetes-version $KUBERNETES_VERSION \
     --control-plane-machine-count $CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT \
     --worker-machine-count $WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT \
     > $CLUSTER_NAME.yaml
   ```

5. **Create the cluster**
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f $CLUSTER_NAME.yaml
   ```

6. **Get the kubeconfig for the new cluster**
   ```sh
   clusterctl get kubeconfig $CLUSTER_NAME > $CLUSTER_NAME.kubeconfig
   ```

### Development Setup

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Set up your Contabo OAuth2 credentials:**
```sh
export CONTABO_CLIENT_ID="your-oauth2-client-id"
export CONTABO_CLIENT_SECRET="your-oauth2-client-secret"
export CONTABO_API_USER="your-contabo-username"
export CONTABO_API_PASSWORD="your-contabo-password"
```

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/cluster-api-provider-contabo:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/cluster-api-provider-contabo:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

**Important:** Before applying the samples, make sure to:
1. Set the Contabo OAuth2 credentials environment variables in the manager deployment:
   - `CONTABO_CLIENT_ID`
   - `CONTABO_CLIENT_SECRET` 
   - `CONTABO_API_USER`
   - `CONTABO_API_PASSWORD`
2. Update the sample configurations with your actual Contabo region and SSH keys
3. Ensure you have valid Contabo instance types and image IDs

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples have valid values for your Contabo account.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Configuration

### API Types

#### ContaboCluster
Manages cluster-wide infrastructure including networking and control plane endpoint.

**Key fields:**
- `region`: Contabo region (e.g., "EU", "US-central", "US-east", "US-west", "SIN")
- `controlPlaneEndpoint`: Kubernetes API server endpoint
- `network`: Network configuration including subnets

#### ContaboMachine
Manages individual VPS instances.

**Key fields:**
- `instanceType`: Contabo VPS plan (e.g., "S", "M", "L", "XL", "XXL")
- `image`: OS image ID (e.g., "ubuntu-22.04", "ubuntu-20.04", "centos-8")
- `region`: Contabo region where the instance will be created
- `sshKeys`: List of SSH key names/IDs
- `userData`: Cloud-init user data (base64 encoded)

#### ContaboMachineTemplate
Template for creating machines with consistent configuration.

### Environment Variables

- `CONTABO_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth2 Client ID from Contabo (required)

### Authentication Setup

The Contabo provider uses OAuth2 authentication with client credentials flow. To set up authentication:

1. **Log in to the Contabo Customer Portal**
2. **Create OAuth2 Application:**
   - Navigate to API settings
   - Create a new OAuth2 application
   - Note down the Client ID and Client Secret
3. **Use your account credentials:**
   - Username: Your Contabo account username
   - Password: Your Contabo account password

The authentication flow automatically obtains access tokens from:
```
https://auth.contabo.com/auth/realms/contabo/protocol/openid-connect/token
```

### Available Regions

## Project Distribution

### Creating a Release

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/cluster-api-provider-contabo:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/cluster-api-provider-contabo/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication errors:**
- Verify your OAuth2 credentials are correct:
  - `CONTABO_CLIENT_ID` and `CONTABO_CLIENT_SECRET` from OAuth2 application
  - `CONTABO_API_USER` and `CONTABO_API_PASSWORD` from your Contabo account
- Check that all credentials are properly set in the environment
- Ensure your OAuth2 application has sufficient API permissions

**Instance creation failures:**
- Verify the instance type is available in your selected region
- Check that the image ID is valid and available
- Ensure your Contabo account has sufficient quota

**Network connectivity issues:**
- Verify security groups and firewall rules allow necessary traffic
- Check that the control plane endpoint is accessible

For more help, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
